description: Trailblazing female Western writer Bertha Muzzy Bower wrote a series
  of pulse-pounding novels about the grizzled vaqueros and cowpokes who populated
  the Flying U Ranch. This novel follows the crew as a territorial conflict emerges
  with a neighboring group of sheep ranchers. Fleshed out with meticulous details
  about the period and plenty of action, Flying U Ranch is a must-read for fans of
  the genre.
